## Additional Details

- **Product Card Hover Interaction**: On the homepage, when a product is displayed and hovered over, it reveals three icons: Zoom, Wishlist, and Add to Cart.
 - **Zoom Functionality**: Since the Figma design did not provide details, I researched on Awwwards.com and implemented this feature to enhance user experience. When the Zoom icon is clicked, a modal opens.
 - **Left Side**: Displays a larger product image for closer inspection.
 - **Right Side**: Includes the product title, price, color selection options, an 'Add to Cart' button, and 'Wishlist' button.
The zoom functionality allows customers to closely inspect products through hover and modal views, improving usability and engagement."


**"Dynamic Product Pages and Add-to-Cart Functionality**:  
On the homepage, each product card displays three colors and three images as selectable options. When a specific **color** or **image** is clicked, the product preview updates to reflect the selected option. Once the **Add to Cart** button is clicked, the **exact image and color** of the product, along with its corresponding details, are added to the **cart** and displayed on the **Cart Page**. 

- **Dynamic Pages**: All dynamic product pages (including homepage and individual product pages) follow this logic. The product card will showcase the three available colors and images. When a color or image is selected, it dynamically updates both the product preview and the **Add to Cart** button.

- **Add-to-Cart Functionality**: The **Add to Cart** functionality ensures seamless shopping by dynamically updating the cart’s state.  
  - If the cart is empty, it will display the message: "Your cart is empty."  
  - Once items are added, the cart will automatically update the **total price** and **item count** based on the selections made. The cart will reflect the **specific image and color** of each product added.

This system ensures that the correct product variations (color and image) are consistently shown across all stages of the purchase process, from product selection to checkout.
